# `cons` Should Not Evaluate its Arguments
- Basically just call-by-need
- Friedman-core
- Landin mentioned jfc. Streams are hype though
- Try not to mention ALGOL 60 impossible
- "Ease the interface between recursive and iterative programmers"
  - Suspending the evaluation makes it work more like a loop, where each step is evaluted only when needed.
  - As they say at the end, makes evaluation top-down, instead of the typical bottom-up
- mfw we did this as a homework assignment in 311
- I can understand a proof, lfg
- The point is that lazy can successfully handle more programs
- WTF is a superinterpreter? I guess it's an actual implementation with lazy
- `label` instead of `define` is foul
- suicidal lmfao
  - I guess this is just the thing where the suspension only coerces once
- Suspending function args like a little dessert
