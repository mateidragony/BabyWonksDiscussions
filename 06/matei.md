# Matei's Notes

- Bro is lazy ah hell
- Streams are hype
- Algol 60 ðŸ’€...
- Page 266 and 267 big picture makes sense I guess I don't fully understand how hes going about it tho. Like you can just say those things but how do you know know fr fr?
- Theorem 1: Everything works just trust me bro
- Theorem 2: You can shove in terrible arguments to cons and it'll still work lel
- Thoerem 3: I'm better in every conceivable way
    - LAZY LAZY LAZY

## Suicidal Suspensions
- Call by need!
- Theorem 4: This works too ðŸ’€
- Theorem 5: Less eval calls. Hooray!

## Implications for File Structure
- Theorem 5 (again?): We can do streams
- Theorem 6: Our streams are cooler tho
- Disgusting inferior levels ðŸ¤®

## Functions which explicitly evaluate arguments
- Varargs idk...

## Conclusion
This paper was pretty chill. If we read this before 311 I think it would have been more hype but this is pretty much review. Still hype tho. We stan Friedman in this house
