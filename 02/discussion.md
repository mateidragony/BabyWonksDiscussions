## Notes about the discussion
Matei told me to put him saying "thanks baby" in the notes

ISWIM is just the framework and ALGOL 60 gets clowned on because it's both a framework and an impelmentation

Is he saying that ISWIM is just the framework for the next 700 programming languages? Like Turing Machines?

Every programming language needs some "primitives" or axioms and then it works, or a piece of tape with 0's and 1's

ALGOL 60 should've been a family instead of a language

Never talks about the rules for user coined names as it's left up to the implementation

Everything that's named will involve a functional relation

1700 doctoral thesis about Church lambda notation stuff

Where clause is like weird Unix guy's with clause

Section 2 is REALLY explicit, which is like shocking

Functional way to make an integer would be to like do a "this number = round this number"

3 and 4 were L sections

This paper could benefit from having examples

Section 4 makes no sense to us 3 undergrads

Section 5 basically talks about what the language looks like

aexpression's and stuff are just 311 interpreter things under a different name

PROGRAM POINT IS CALL/CC

Section 6 is clowning on LISP, and we have decided we don't care about the "lisp stuff"

Section 7, first group goes over "if two things are equal we can change them for each other", and the rule beta is just a beta reduction

Rule D'' is the weirdest way to define a list, h is car, t is cdr, and t' is cdr of cdr is null, basically D'' defined a cons list

Matei says favorite paper, this is the paper of all time because car and cdr mentioned

Calvin and Matei went through and attempted to verify the functional equivalence in section 7, however the author forgot a step so whoopsies on his part, I however was just chilling during this

Section 8's final paragraph is the author just trolling at this point

Section 9 is once again hating on lisp

Declarative/Denotative allows you to get what you want, but no optimizing

Imperative allows for more optimizations and to tell the computer what's happening

Conclusion: This is truely one of the papers of all times
