# Calvin's Awesome Thoughts
> :memo: Formatted as a beautiful numbered list

1. I love writing markdown in the github editor!
2. Expressing things in terms of other things | basic set of things ðŸ’€
  - I guess it is intersting that he establishes this dichotomy between the language elements and their combination?
3. recondite is a great word
4. I'm assuming that `let` is basically a `where` clause, just with different syntax. (it is, I'm so smart ðŸ¤“)
5. Physical and logical - bro is not the one who can have 1 programming language ðŸ’€
  - I'm assuming that the idea is physical being used to communicate in the paper, but notnecesarily the canon implementation.
  - This is actually an interesting idea - I shouldn't troll
6. Section 4 is starting to lose me ðŸ˜Ÿ. Is ISWIM a description of how to describe language families? ðŸ˜µ
  - Looking back at section 1, he says ISWIM itself is a family
  - Thinking of languages as beeing isomorphic, even with
7. Amelioration is another 5 dollar word.
8. Program equivalence in section 7 - I'm too lazy to do now, but would like to talk about in disussion. I think it is a cool idea though!
9. wtf is 'evolutionary trend towards "bigger righthand sides"'?
10. 'denotative' (functional) vs. 'imperative'
11. This paper is hilarious: "It is a trivial and pointless task to rearrange some piece of symbolism into prefixed operators and heavy bracketing."
12. Bro doesn't want to annoy the `goto` fans.
13. "a new language is a point chosen from a well-mapped space, rather than a laboriously devised construction."
14. I still don't understand what ISWIM is ðŸ’€
