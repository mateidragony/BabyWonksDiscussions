# On computable numbers, with an application to the entscheidungsproblem

- Turing! ðŸ™ƒ
- Entscheidungsproblem is just can this problem be logically proven or no.
- Bro just chose te easiest thing to prove ðŸ’€

## 1. Computing machines
- Is human memory limited? Just have children and use their memory as an extension of yours. That way you can theoretically have infinte children, ergo infinite memory.
- Theory of machines are familiar to the reader ðŸ˜Ž. This Turing guy is smart.

## 2. Definitions
- Vocab words
- What is difference between symbols of the first kind and of the second kind?

## 3. Examples of computing machines
- Oh wow, you can print 0101010101...!!
- Wait wouldn't this be 0_1_0_1_0_...
- Bro is right that it is useful to use alternate squares
- Damn this Turing guy may be intelligent

## 4. Abbreviated tables
- Functions!!! Bro is functional pilled
- This is getting funky
- Bro is alpha converting for readability
- What the hell is bro waffling about now wtf

## 5. Enumeration of computable sequences
- Yeah let me go ahead and standradize this program real quick: 51361243651234561425641256341236745124351426341265345612345676512435614235641623461. This computes the circumference of your fat balls. You're welcome.
- Machine code be like.

## 6. The universal computing machine
- We can make a machine that computes all machines
- I don't fully understand this section

## 7. Detailed description of the universal machine
- Ok he's explaining himself
- Slay Alan Slay
- I ain't reading allat. We can discuss in discussion

## 8. Application of the diagonal process
- Why must there exist a number $K$ such that $1-\phi_n(n) = \phi_K(n)$ all $n$?
- Yoooo he said the thing! We can't test if a program is circular or not!!!
- If the combined machine never prints out 0 then $M, M_1, M_2, \ldots$ all have a 0 and since $M_n$ prints $n$ less 0 than $M$, then $M$ prints infinitely many 0. 
- Bro this kid is hecca smart wtf. He just says things then it takes me 30 minutes to understand and I'm like holy christ

## 9. The extent of the computable numbers
- This kid really came up with 3 ways of explaining this so us cavemen can actually understand what he's saying.
- Type (a)
    - Lol we can have symbols that are different by one atom of ink ðŸ’€
    - Chinese mentioned. Where's Spoosh
    - Unnecessarily gendering the computer smh my head Alan
    - Theorem 157767733443477 ðŸ’€ðŸ’€
    - Ok so computer can compute.
    - Oh lol I read Paragraph 1 again and that's all we've been trying to prove ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€
- Type (b)
    - Ok what the hell
    - Is this based off of some archaic math that I don't know about??
- III
    - Computer takes a break...
    - slay

## 10. Examples of large classes of numbers which are computable
- What??
- Leaving this up to discussion I'm so lost

## 11. Application to the Entscheidungsproblem
- Fucking finally we get to the titular part of this paper
- I ain't reading that book sorry Alan
-
