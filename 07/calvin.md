# Predicate Logic as Programming Language

- Interesting conceptualization as programming language being about expressing algorithms in a matter closer to concuptualization.
- Predicate logic is about formalizing thought

- This is some mini-kanren bullshit

- Bro is talking about proving with counter examples
- "without deriving logical consequences that do not play a role in the construction"?????

- Given a goal statement, we always just apply the only matching procedure until we get to a halt!
  - It "collapses"and runs out of things because allvariables have been defined.

- Non determinism seems just like the multiple results from mini kanren?

- Bogo sort mentioned let's goooooooo
- S1.2 absolutely unhinged. S1.3 might be my favorite sorting algorithm

- Chill paper, basically saying "hey look!"
- Minikanren with extra steps
