## TWO MILNER PAPERS IN A ROW BECAUSE OF COURSE

What the shrimp is $\lambda-\Kappa \Beta$ calculus???

Ah yes, my $\lambda - \Kappa \Beta \delta$ calculus that I haven't used since the Heian era

The $\lambda$ calculus rules in this paper define a variable, constant, the appication of a term onto a variable, and the like combination of two terms as terms also

A term is a value if it is not a combination

If terms $M,N s.t. M = N$ then $M, N$ are identical terms

All terms have free and bound variables

A term is closed if it has no free variables, otherwise it's open

What the scallop is $\xrightarrow{p}$ 
* Nevermind I had a reading comprehension issues

A dump is a Stack, Control String, Environment, and Dom(Environment)

I just skipped like half the  paper by not reading one proof holy bass

Oh my god why are there so many lemmnas I'm not reading allat I'm just going to read the theorems and trust that it work as I'm juts a lowely undergrad

Alright so sections 5 and 6 use freaky math language to define call by value and name

Okay I'm sorry but this guy loves using greek letters more than someone in a fraternity like my guy $\Psi$ has zero meaning it's just a trident looking thing to me but nooo it means take a term from $_v$ and put it into $_n$ or vice versa

Okay so, I don't really like this paper as it uses lambda calclulus to prove that Call-By-Value can do what Call-By-Name does, which like to me is obvious however I understand that it's good to prove that, however I just don't care for the proof

Anyways, with that I don't have anything to say about the paper, sorry but it just doesn't appeal to me as I'm not really a "proofy math guy"
