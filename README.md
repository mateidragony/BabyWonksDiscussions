# Baby Wonks Discussions ðŸ‘¶

## About

Matei, Shulin and Calvin's personal thoughts and shared thoughts about a select few papers related to Computer Science and Programming Languages. We read one paper a week and host a discussion on Saturdays to share what we have learned and what we have taken away from the reading. This discussions help us stay motivated to expand our knowledge of this wonderful field.

Name and inspiration derived from the [PL Wonks](http://wonks.github.io/) group at Indiana University in Bloomington.

We were mainly following the papers in [this list](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/courses/670Fall04/GreatWorksInPL.shtml) collected by Benjamin C. Pierce, however now days we read anything that we find interesting.
