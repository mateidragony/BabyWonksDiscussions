# A Theory of Type Polymorphism is Programming
### By Robin Milner

**Polymorphism:** having flexibility in types

Primitive polymorphic operators - it almost feels like arguing that polymorphism is the natural way of things.

The paper describes a method of gaining type flexibility, while still ensuring
robust programs.

Types are built from a set of basic types (int, bool, etc.), $\times$ (cartesian product), $+$ (disjoint sum), $\rightarrow$ (function), and `list`.

Polymorphic types are obtained by using *type variables* ($\alpha, \beta, \gamma, ...$).

Arbitrary types: ($\rho, \sigma, \tau$).


## Example 1: `map`
```clojure
(letrec ((map (lambda (f m)
            (if (null? m) 
                '() 
                (cons (f (car m)) (map (cdr m))))))))
```

Since the function map takes a function from things of one type to things of another type, we say it has type
$$((\alpha \rightarrow \beta) \times \alpha \text{ list}) \rightarrow \beta \text{ list}$$

How do we determine this from the bare declaration?
- We know the generic types of free identifiers (car, cdr, null?, '(), etc.)
- For each occurence of these variables, they must satisfy some requirements
- We can use `unify` to combine these requirements

For efficienct, the compiler should distinguish between differetn calls to `map` with
different monotypes.

## Example 2 `tagpair`
We want a function tagpair, such that `(tagpair a)` is a function under which 
$$(b . c) \vdash ((a . b) . (a . c))$$
```clojure
(define (tagpair a) 
    (lambda (b c)
        `((,a . ,b) . (,b . ,c))))
```
But we could define it differently

\* My guess is that `#` takes two functions and returs a function of two arguments that returns a pair with each function applied to each argument
```clojure
(define (pair a)
    (lambda (b)
        `(,a . ,b)))

(define tagpair
    (lambda (a)
        (let ((tag (pair a)))
            (tag # tag))))
```
1. $\alpha$ is assigned to a
2. pair($a$) acquires $\delta \rightarrow \alpha \times \delta$
3. This is used as the local generic type of tag
4. The tags are assigned
$\beta \rightarrow \alpha_1 \times \beta$ and
$\gamma \rightarrow \alpha_2 \times \gamma$
5. `#` is assigned an instance of its generic type
and the type equation for function application will
assign `(tag # tag)` the type
$\beta \times \gamma \rightarrow (\alpha_1 \times \beta) \times (\alpha_2 \times \gamma)$
6. tagpair acquires $\alpha \rightarrow (\beta \times \gamma \rightarrow (\alpha_1 \times \beta) \times (\alpha_2 \times \gamma))$

Something has gone wrong!

When instantiating the type of a variable bound by $let$
or $letrec$, only those type variables which don't occur in enclosing lambda-bindings may be instantiated.

In step 2 above, $\alpha$ is not generic, so when we get to 4, it stays as $\alpha$ instead of instantiating new instances.

So the rules for typing variables bound by $let$ and lambda are gonna be different!.

Example:
```clojure
(let ((I (lambda (x) x)))
    (I I))

((lambda (I) (I I)) 
    (lambda (x) x))
```
We could assign types to the former but not to the latter.


The lambda-abstraction may occur without an argument, creating an additional constraint

Consistent treatment of the nonglobal declaration
of a procedure that may contain a formal parameter of an enclosing procedure. This makes polymorphisming harder.
