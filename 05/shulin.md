# I have 7 hours until I have to get on an airplane, so instead of writing a MMU driver I'm reading this paper!!!!

Bro really started off by citing SEVEN sources as to how basic principles were controversial

I'm already lost because I don't know what he means by represents, god dangit

REPRESENTATION INDEPENDENCE MENTIONED :O

This paper feels really old, like I know that most of the papers that we've read so far were conceived before the internet was a thing, but they didn't feel as dated as this paper, which mentions that polymorphic functions are a neglected subject matter, even though today with the advent of gradual typing (Siek please pass me in compilers) it's talked about a fair amount

"polymorphic sort function" MY BROTHER IN CHRIST THOSE ARE IMPLEMENTED VIA INTERFACES TODAY

PERMIT TYPES TO BE PASSED AS A SEPARATE PARAMETER??? THAT'S GENERICS OH MY GOD THIS PAPER MIGHT BE A FOUNDATION FOR ALMOST EVERYTHING I KNOW ABOUT OOP

"polymorphic functions" today seems to be what we call generic functions

Doubling function: $f(f(x))$
* CS dudes on their way to define random functions they see a lot in theory but almost never in practice

Okay ngl I understand that this may be the first time someone tried to standardize generics, but oh my god this syntax is literally the worst thing to grace my eyes since seeing your mother (yes you the readers mother)
* "Admittedly this is hard to read" LMAOOOOOOOOO "amenable to judicious syntatic sweetening" BRO IS NOT A COFFEE SNOB

The representation theorem is going to be another form of semantic soundness theorem (SST) I'm calling it now

$S'^{^S}$ who let this man cook up syntax, he's never allowed in the kitchen again, it's so complicated to type that out in latex I've gotta do "S'^{^S}" instead of "S' \to S" but then again latex didn't exist, but you know what did ALREADY STANDARDIZED NOTATION

Okay that $\Pi$ stuff is worse as $\Pi$ is already reserved for multiplcation of many elements

$[f \mid x \mid x']$ seems to be the extend-environment function we see in C311

"We have omitted complete parenthesization" NO PLEASE CONTINUE ADDING PARENTHESIS IT'S SO MUCH MORE READABLE

This paper is fun to read because I'm a hater on this guys syntax and boy does he introduce a lot of it

Yeah I'm not reading the rules of the set $R_{QW}$, they probably make sense

Ah yes, my lattice-theoritic approach that I haven't used since the Heian era

Hello everyone it's me Shulin I forgot to read the rest of this paper so now I have 2 hours to get through it so let's go!!!!

$M_{QW}$ exists because we need to make this a bit more syntatically bloated

Okay I'm lost on that $\phi, \psi$ now oh god, but I think it's saying that $\phi$ converts from one representaion $D$ to another $D'$, and $\psi$ is the inverse function $D' \to D$, and the composition of the two functions represent an identity function $I_D$ or $I_{D'}$ 

Alright STOP, LOOK AT $\bar{D'}$, there are SO MANY modifiers 

CATEGORIES MENTIONED :O

Okay at first the categories made more sense, but as soon as I saw the word bifunctor I was gone

Ending on Ackerman's function seemed to warrant the same omg moment like in the end scene of civil war where we see Thanos like fine I'll do it myself, instead I'm not smart enough to understand why I'm supposed to feel this way

Anyways, this paper (as outlined in the conclusion) sought to give mathematical meaning to types, and I think it suceeded in doing so, even if I was hating on the syntax the entire time. Overall I enjoyed the paper, however towards the end I got really lost
