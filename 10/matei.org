#+TITLE: Sequent Calculus as a Compiler Intermediate Language
#+AUTHOR: Matei Cloteaux

* Introduction
- This is so conversational
- Appel?
- OMG a Cinderella story!
  
* Sequent Core
** Overview
- Wtf is this syntax???
- Please lord explain continuation binding
- What is the capital lambda. Also constructor application???
- Cut pair? Ayo do we have goto?
- Oh shit they explain cut pair...
- Oh is capital lambda polymorphic type?
- Bro is that a fucking typo in the core drop? Isn't it supposed to be `reverse a ys`
** The Language
- jump!!!
** Terms and Continuations
- Ah yes weak head normal forms. That clears things up for me!
- Lazy mentioned. Wait this is Haskell obviously lazy mentioned...
- I don't think I understand $\mu$ abstractions...
** Binding and Jumps
- Ok maybe this makes sense
** The scope of labels
- Nvm this doesn't make sense...
** Operational semantics
- Dawg what in the fuck is Figure 2...
- Ah Yes Figure 3. Wondeful!
** Type System
- Shulin please explain Figure 4
- And the rest of this section
  
* Translating to and from Core
** The definitional translation
- Sure this seems fine
** A more efficient translation
- $\mu$ abstractions go brrr
- Bro its literally just CPS.
- Cool shrinking stuff
** Translating back to Core
- There and back again. OMG pl paper mentioned by moi???
- Its not CPS
** Round trips
- Bro what is a round trip translation? Are you atcually able to undo
- Why do we lose continuations?
* From theory to practice
** Sequent Core in GHC
- Bro they did that shit in a few months?!
- Simplify the simplifier ðŸ’€
- They failed...
- But wait maybe not!
** Join points and case-of-case
- Cool stuff
** Losing join points
- Woah Sequent Calculus rocks!
* Contification
- Oh ok maybe I understand why we might want continuations back.
- Ok this makes sense. You want to contify all the time to be
  able to catch those join points.
** Analysis and transformation
- Bottom up? DP? DP mentioned!!!
- Ok just find all the contifiable terms and contify them. cool.
- Big fan of all the performace tests they ran. This paper is
  very thorough.
** Discovering join points
- Super cool. Exploit them join points girl.
** Caveats
- There's always gotta be caveats...
- Fuck types man all my homies hate types
* Related work
** Relation to Sequent Calculi
- This kinda went over my head ngl
** CPS as an intermediate language
- Sure. Sequent Calculus is kinda CPS but only in the good ways.
  Its actually readble.
** ANF as an intermediate language
- Holy Amr normal form. My goat.
- Fuck Kennedy. We love ANF.
** Other representations
- Eh who cares about imperative languages anyway.
- SSA? I hardly know ey
* Reflections on intermediate languages
- Amr mentioned again! What a fucking goat.
- Very empirical evidence for Figure 8. It's giving check + grade.
