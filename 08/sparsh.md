# wtf is a goto statement

- The paper is fairly interesting
- Primarily used for Assembly code/C?
- Apparently I should've learned how this stuff works in C335
- Makes it a headache since you're just making it jump everywhere
- Overall I learned why goto statments bad, apparently this is the shortest paper reviewed so far.
